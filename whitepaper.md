## Introduction

In this technology and media-driven age, the stratospheric rise of cryptocurrencies, electronic currencies which are decentralised, anonymous, and freely tradable, is not surprising. Currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have demonstrated that it is possible to use the internet, now ubiquitous and fast in many countries, to make a decentralised value-transfer system which is virtually free to use and can be shared across the world at very fast speeds. It can seem that there is an ideological gap between hard-asset investors, such as those preferring to invest in precious metals such as gold and silver, and the early adopters of electronic currencies. However, there are many similarities between these two currencies, such as the finite supply (both precious metals and most cryptocurrencies need to be mined and are limited) and durability (both of these value-storage methods retain their value almost indefinitely). The time is therefore ripe for a cryptocurrency based on precious metals, retaining the security of the latter, while adding the flexibility of an electronic currency.

Value Units, is such a currency, based on precious metals which represent the Value Basket (the book value of the cryptocurrency). Additionally to this most iconic feature, Value Units want to provide other distinct capabilities, by taking the best approaches of other cryptocurrencies and combining them with new breakthrough ideas to build the best available cryptocurrency in the market

## Overview

The Value Units Foundation (VUF) has been working for month in designing a first class unique cryptocurrency that offer many interesting and innovative features that can't be found in other alternatives in the diverse cryptocurrency world.
